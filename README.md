Python scripts developed for Assignment 2 from Module 3: Control Structures in Python. Includes programs using if-else statements and loops to perform basic logic-based tasks.
# 🐍 Assignment 2: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python programs created as part of Assignment 2 under Module 3: Control Structures in Python.

The tasks demonstrate the use of conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for loop`) in Python.

## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

📌 Problem Statement:  
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

📄 Filename: `task1_even_odd_checker.py`

🖥 Sample Output:
Enter a number: 7 
7 is an odd number

## ✅ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

📌 Problem Statement:  
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

📄 Filename: `task2_sum_1_to_50.py`

🖥 Sample Output:
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
